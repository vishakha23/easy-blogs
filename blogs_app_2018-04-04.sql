It\'s also the biggest one that remains unsolved. Decades later, it still captures the public\'s attention every time it\'s in the news. Multiple books have been written about the case over the years; a true crime podcast called \"<a href=\"https://audioboom.com/channel/empty-frames\">Empty Frames</a>\" launched in February that aims to take a fresh look at all the evidence and perhaps eventually solve the case.</p><p>The empty frames still hang on the walls of the Gardner Museum, a potent and haunting reminder of what was lost in this theft. But now, a firm called Cuseum is using AR to restore these priceless pieces of art to the walls of the Gardner Museum -- at least, digitally.</p><p><img data-credit=\"Cuseum\" data-mep=\"2557949\" src=\"https://s.aolcdn.com/hss/storage/midas/335642edc0cd9ba44f019ff9351cbd77/206245295/HiRes-ISGM-Empty-Angle.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p><a href=\"https://www.cuseum.com/\">Cuseum</a> works to make museums and other cultural institutions <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2017/05/31/googles-virtual-museum-tours-tell-you-more-about-the-art/\">more accessible</a> through the use of cutting-edge technology. One example is the ability to digitally guide visitors through spaces without a language barrier. \"Imagine if museums could clone their best guide or docent, have them available 24/7, and with the ability to speak multiple languages,\" Brendan Ciecko, the founder of Cuseum, explained to Engadget. \"Our platform empowers museums to do that.\"</p><p>Ciecko\'s team had long been fascinated by the Gardner heist. \"Recently, after testing some new prototypes at a local museum and showing my team the results, one of my colleagues suggested the idea of putting the stolen art back in the frames at the Gardner,\" Ciecko said. \"I was psyched to explore this concept further -- the opportunity to explore something new, the technological challenge, and the idea of returning something to its rightful home. Additionally, Isabella Stewart Gardner was a true innovator of her time, and what better way to celebrate her pioneering spirit, and return her beloved collection back to its original state, even if only through a digital lens.\"</p><p><div class=\"fluid-width-video-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top: 56.25%;\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" mozallowfullscreen=\"\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/260604698\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"\" id=\"fitvid0\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></div></p><p><a href=\"https://www.hackingtheheist.com/\">\"Hacking the Heist\"</a> is an independent passion project for the team at Cuseum. It wasn\'t paid for by and is not affiliated with the Gardner Museum. The app that was developed using Apple\'s ARKit. \"Once Apple\'s ARKit was released it marked a new chapter for app developers,\" Ciecko explained. \"Compared to other frameworks, the quality and stability was incredibly promising right from the start. With the latest release, ARKit 1.5, Apple introduced vertical surface detection and on-device image recognition, which were key components needed to make this project possible.\"</p><p>The app isn\'t publicly available yet -- the Cuseum team is waiting for iOS 11.3, which supports this type of AR, to be released. Once it is, though, visitors to the museum with iOS devices will be able to download the app. Once they\'ve pulled it up, they can aim their smartphone or tablet at the empty frames where these priceless paintings once hung. Through an imaginative use of AR, the app will fill in the blanks -- quite literally. People will be able to see what the missing paintings looked like hanging on the walls of the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum.</p><p>The app currently only covers two of the most popular missing paintings: \"A Lady and Gentleman in Black\" and \"Christ in the Storm on the Sea of Galilee,\" which were both painted by Rembrandt. The latter is his only known seascape. However, the team at Cuseum hopes to add more of the missing art in the future.</p><p>\"Hacking the Heist\" isn\'t the only augmented reality project that Cuseum is working on, either. The company is developing more AR tools with multiple museums across North America to enhance visitor experiences. <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/256005802\">At the </a><a href=\"http://www.pamm.org/ar\">Perez Art Museum in Miami</a>, the team at Cuseum recently helped launch both the first instance of ARKit in a museum, as well as the \"world\'s first fully AR-powered museum exhibition.\" It features the works of Miami-based artist Felice Grodin and contains four digital works that examine the relationship between the mental and the physical.</p><p><div class=\"fluid-width-video-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top: 133.281%;\"><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" mozallowfullscreen=\"\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/256005802\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"\" id=\"fitvid1\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></div></p><p>It\'s clear that augmented reality can affect and enhance the way we interact with museums and cultural institutions. With the Gardner Museum in particular, AR can educate visitors about the theft and help complete their experiences by \"filling in\" the paintings that are missing. \"We hope people feel a deeper connection with the works that would have otherwise been hanging in the empty frames,\" Ciecko concluded. \"Many visitors are either unaware of the heist and its magnitude, or don\'t know what the stolen masterpieces even looked like. We also hope this inspires people to think about the ways in which technology can show us things that no longer exist and transform the experience we have at those moments.\"</p><p><span class=\"t-meta c-gray-4\">Image: Cuseum</span></p>\n\n                          </div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n','2018-04-04 00:57:35','https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?quality=100&image_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fo.aolcdn.com%2Fhss%2Fstorage%2Fmidas%2F2a37beb9e1ed0397edd907a00af44682%2F206245640%2Fpaintings-ed.jpg&client=cbc79c14efcebee57402&signature=d792e9cda6c1ba94a7d50a320572b8cc78d9a62f',10,'\'Hacking the Heist\' superimposes the paintings using Apple\'s ARKit.','An AR app returns stolen Gardner paintings to their frames','2018-04-04 00:57:35',3),

One is for residential homes and buildings that use solar or wind energy, storing energy and releasing it at night or if the power goes out. Another is to use the batteries for \"smart booths\" that could power cellphones and other devices. Finally, Nissan unveiled a whimsical scheme, \"a park converting the bursting energy of children into electricity while they play. Children\'s energy during the day keeps the park bright and safe at nighttime.\"</p><p>Much like Renault\'s \"<a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2018/02/21/renault-ev-second-life-batteries-smart-island/\">Smart Island</a>,\" Nissan\'s Light Reborn project is more a small-scale test and way to market its green credentials. Namie, Japan, is a particularly poignant location for a test, as the nearby Fukushima nuclear plant lost power during an earthquake and tsunami, causing a partial meltdown of the core.</p><p>So far, only Tesla has truly made a big push into the consumer market with its Powerwall batteries and solar panels.

The past few years have shown that Facebook is a petri dish for cultural disease, the Typhoid Mary of memes.</p><p>First there was the election hacking, in which foreign actors sought to foster division in communities by driving wedge issues. Then the fake news, through which hucksters sought to throw any old lie into the cultural milieu and make a profit on the ad sales, helping break down people\'s credulity and convince them that some pretty insane stuff was happening when it clearly wasn\'t.</p><p>Now, thanks to the tireless, years-long work of journalists like Carole Cadwalladr, Facebook has finally admitted that its user data has been weaponized. Specifically, a trove of profiles that were sold to a branch of the SCL Group, Cambridge Analytica (CA), a private \"strategic communications\" firm. Which is a euphemistic way to describe a private propaganda agency backed by a cadre of right-wing billionaires.</p><p>Facebook\'s role in this was to provide the platform and, wittingly or not, allow these organizations to run riot. It didn\'t sanction the sale of the data to CA, but it has known about the sale since the end of 2015. In his <i>NYT </i>Interview, Zuckerberg said that Facebook demanded that CA \"legally certify that they didn\'t have the data, and weren\'t using it.\" Except that, as he added shortly after, the \"formal and legal certification\" CA provided was apparently false.</p><p>Zuckerberg also said that he didn\'t expect to become the world\'s arbiter of free speech, and he wants the policies to be shaped by the community. Unfortunately, there is no one-size-fits-all model that will apply globally, because every culture is different. Take <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/blogs/erasmus/2017/08/anti-religious-speech\">blasphemy</a>: While in the US you would be unlikely to face punishment for taking the Lord\'s name in vain, it\'s a different situation in other countries.</p><p>That is, perhaps, the problem with building a platform that you want to be universal and then forgetting that other people don\'t necessarily share your values. Zuckerberg says that the Facebook project of \"building a community for people all over the world\" to \"connect across boundaries\" is unprecedented. The fallout from those connections, or even just from sharing the information globally, can be problematic in the extreme. For instance, with the violence in Myanmar, the company stands accused of <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2017/09/20/facebook-accused-of-supporting-ethnic-cleansing-in-myanmar/\">condoning the massacre</a> of Rohingya Muslims because it censored posts from a resistance group.</p><p><div class=\"fluid-width-video-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top: 56.25%;\"><iframe allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/G6DOhioBfyY?enablejsapi=1\" id=\"1522572025644_TBOtherPlayer_10\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></div></p><p>Zuckerberg\'s response was almost offensively anodyne, saying that he and his team are seeing \"new challenges that [he] didn\'t think anyone had anticipated before.\" He added that he didn\'t believe it was possible to \"know every issue that you\'re going to face down the road.\" And that the company has a \"real responsibility to take all these issues seriously as they come up\" and \"make sure we solve them.\"</p><p>Sadly, the time for such na�vet� has long since passed, especially as Facebook can now see where its action -- or inaction -- has led. It is not wholly responsible, sure, but it has been at least partially complicit in the current turmoil in the US, the fracturing of the European Union and plenty of violence. Not to mention that the problems that Zuckerberg says were impossible to predict were ... <a href=\"https://twitter.com/zeynep/status/976813674877812736\">fairly easy to predict</a>.</p><p>It\'s hard not to feel a little sympathy for Zuckerberg as the techno-utopia he created begins to twist and crack under its own weight. If it was his plan to build an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agora\">Agora</a> for the modern world, a town square where the millennial versions of Plato and Socrates teach and debate, then he must be disappointed. After all, in their place, Facebook has instead helped spread the gospel of modern-day intellectual flyweights.</p><p>Not to mention all of the people raking him over the coals for not responding sooner, or the senators demanding that he show up and testify before Congress. It is a little unfair to demand that the CEO of a company that employs 25,000 people be aware of the minutiae of every aspect of their business. On the other hand, if Zuckerberg isn\'t spending every waking hour of his day trying to solve this crisis, then something is very wrong.</p><p>In his CNN interview, Zuckerberg said that he welcomes regulation, so long as it\'s the \"right kind\" of regulation. He declined to explain precisely what that would entail, but said he\'d love to see tighter rules around online \"ad transparency.\" Online ads are, after all, a wilderness compared with the worlds of print and TV, where there are obligations to disclose where the money has come from.</p><p>It\'s just a <i>shame</i>, you know? That Facebook, a company that has <i>never</i> sold ads and <i>doesn\'t</i> have a dominant position in the online media world, is powerless in this context. If it were a massive ad platform that had a huge chunk of the ad market, then it could have tightened its own standards years ago, before regulators stepped in. In fact, that would demonstrate a level of leadership that, in turn, would demonstrate a real commitment to change. Wouldn\'t that be cool?</p><p>Perhaps it was unfair to castigate Zuckerberg for not speaking out on this issue sooner, as if rushing to judgment is somehow an admirable quality. It is right, and something that should be lauded, that people don\'t simply open their yaps and begin speaking as soon as they\'re asked a question. People should never be bullied for wanting to know something before sharing their opinion on it.</p><p>The problem for Zuckerberg, of course, is that journalists first informed Facebook about the Cambridge Analytica leak at the tail end of 2015. It\'s tough to argue that he didn\'t have enough time to prepare a response.</p>\n\n                          </div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n','2018-04-08 00:57:35','https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?quality=100&image_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fo.aolcdn.com%2Fhss%2Fstorage%2Fmidas%2F3bebb8335acf803be06987df597001c1%2F206236140%2Fzucksuit-ed.jpg&client=cbc79c14efcebee57402&signature=ca3543da8082e6ca241a93a142f21cda0325f7ec',10,'Uneasy lies the head that wears Facebook\'s crown.','Mark Zuckerberg broke his silence, but he didn\'t have much to say','2018-04-08 00:57:35',1),

On a clear day, the process is pretty simple. But on a foggy day, the light scatters and is often reflected by water particles within the air, rather than objects a vehicle needs to avoid.</p><p>This made any time-of-flight system for autonomous vehicles somewhat less useful in foggy conditions. But the team at MIT realized that statistics could compensate for the reduction in accuracy. Regardless of fog thickness, the light reflections corresponded with a pattern called the gamma distribution. The system they developed can use this information to remove the fog reflections from the equation entirely. What\'s left is actual objects that need to be avoided.</p><p>You can read about the technology more in depth at <a href=\"http://news.mit.edu/2018/depth-sensing-imaging-system-can-peer-through-fog-0321\"><em>MIT News</em></a>, but the bottom line is that this could help self-driving vehicles better master poor weather conditions.

Nuclear fusion stands to be more efficient, cleaner and safer than other methods, but it has been rather <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2017/06/21/nuclear-fusion-runaway-electron-problem-solved/\">hard to put into action</a>. The process generates incredibly high temperatures and requires a lot of energy input -- an amount that has outweighed outputs so far -- and those issues have prevented nuclear fusion from becoming a viable energy source to date.</p><p>The extremely high temperatures require that <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2016/11/28/new-magnetic-field-theory-gets-us-closer-to-nuclear-fusion/\">magnetic fields</a>, rather than solid materials, confine the hot plasma in which the fusion reactions take place. MIT and CFS plan to use newly available superconducting materials to develop large electromagnets that can produce fields four-times stronger than any being used now. The stronger magnetic fields will allow for more power to be generated resulting in, importantly, positive net energy. The method will hopefully allow for cheaper and smaller reactors. The research team aims to develop a prototype reactor within the next 10 years, followed by a 200-megawatt pilot power plant. \"If MIT can do what they are saying -- and I have no reason to think that they can\'t -- this is a major step forward,\" Stephen Dean, head of Maryland-based advocacy group Fusion Power Associates, told <em>Nature</em>.</p><p>The team sees their work as being complementary to what will take place at the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2017/12/06/the-colossal-iter-fusion-power-facility-is-halfway-finished/\">ITER tokamak fusion reactor</a> currently being built in France.

However, throughout the report, there are very few cases where actual action has been taken. Instead, it more often details changes to policy, convening of councils or advisory boards and commissioning of reports -- all of which amounts to a lot of talk and hardly any action.</p><p>The OSTP report mentions formations of the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2017/05/01/donald-trump-american-technology-council/\">American Technology Council</a>, the Office of American Innovation and the President\'s Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis as well as the revival of the <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2017/06/30/-national-space-council-trump-pence/\">National Space Council</a>. It also mentions summits and meetings that members of the administration took part in including the American Leadership in Emerging Technology Summit, the G7 Information and Communications Technology Ministerial and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Economic Leaders\' Meeting. Also sprinkled throughout the report are various executive orders aimed at reviewing and ultimately gutting previous policies as well as a handful of reports that have been produced but as of yet not followed up on. When you take away all of the meetings, empty orders and stagnant reports, you\'re left with a list of accomplishments that are largely limited to <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2017/10/25/trump-program-test-drones-beyond-faa-regulations/\">tests of drone deregulation</a>, a call for <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2017/09/26/tech-support-trump-stem-education/\">more money to be dedicated to promoting STEM education</a>, Nobel prize winners whose work was completed well before Trump entered office and a bump in NASA\'s proposed budget.</p><p>However, that\'s not to say that the Trump administration hasn\'t had an impact on science and technology or that no action has been taken. It\'s just that the efforts that will likely have the most lasting effects on technological innovation and scientific discovery weren\'t included in the OSTP\'s report. Many of them are, however, very much worth mentioning.</p><p>For example, the report notes that Trump\'s proposed 2018 budget includes a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2018/02/12/trump-s-new-budget-wont-land-us-on-the-moon-anytime-soon/\">2 percent increase in NASA funding</a> compared to 2017. What it doesn\'t mention are the massive cuts to various other science-focused agencies. The proposed budget suggests ending a handful of satellite programs, including the upcoming <a href=\"https://pace.gsfc.nasa.gov\">PACE mission</a>, reducing NOAA and US Geological Survey budgets by 20 percent each, cutting the EPA\'s Office of Science and Technology budget by over a third and no increase to National Science Foundation or <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2018/01/31/trump-seeks-budget-cuts-clean-energy-research/\">Department of Energy science program funding</a>.</p><p>Additionally, the report touts Trump\'s opioid epidemic advisory board and his declaration of a national public health emergency, but it doesn\'t mention that no money has been allocated towards recovery and prevention efforts. Similarly, the OSTP applauds two executive orders signed by the president that are largely geared towards <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2018/01/09/president-trump-signs-order-to-promote-broadband-in-rural-areas/\">removing some red tape involved in deploying broadband</a>, but again, those do not come with any additional funding to close the rural broadband gap even though Trump has claimed that\'s <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2017/06/22/trump-infrastructure-proposal-rural-broadband-expansion/\">a goal of his presidency</a>.</p><p>Other actions taken by Trump and his administration since his inauguration include <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2017/02/17/climate-change-skeptic-scott-pruitt-heads-epa/\">appointing a climate change denier to helm the EPA</a>, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2017/03/28/trump-climate-change-roll-back-policy-coal-obama/\">rolling back Obama-era climate change policies</a>, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2017/04/29/epa-pulls-climate-science-web-pages/\">pulling climate science information from the EPA website</a>, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2017/06/01/trump-withdraws-us-paris-agreement/\">withdrawing the US from the Paris climate change agreement</a>, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2017/08/08/usda-censors-climate-change-language/\">telling staff to stop directly referring to climate change</a>, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2017/08/16/trump-dissolves-advisory-councils/\">dissolved his manufacturing council</a>, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2017/10/09/epa-plans-to-repeal-clean-power-plan/\">withdrawal of the Clean Power Plan</a>, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2017/12/20/trump-removes-climate-change-from-national-security-strategy/\">removing climate change from the national security strategy</a>, <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2018/01/23/trump-30-percent-solar-tariffs-job-losses/\">instituting solar cell tariffs</a> and <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2018/02/11/trump-administration-hopes-to-privatize-iss/\">planning to defund the ISS</a>.

It notes at the very beginning of the report that it has \"over 50 staff members,\" but that\'s far less than over <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2017/08/07/obamas-science-advisors-hard-at-work/\">100-strong staff the office had</a> during the Obama years and Trump <em>still</em> hasn\'t appointed a director to oversee the agency.</p><p>Taking together all of Trump\'s actions in regards to science and technology, his administration can\'t possibly be seen as an empowerer of innovation or advancement.

What\'s more, this method trains the user to activate specific neural pathways for voluntary movement, which helps them improve their ability to walk unassisted.</p><p>You will need at least some degree of sensation, however, for the treatment to work, Dr. Geneva Tonuzi, Medical Director of the Brooks Cybernic Treatment Center, told Engadget. \"It doesn\'t have to be much, but there has to be at least that signal.

Nothing is certain yet, but in September, NASA pushed the launch date of the telescope back to between March and June of 2019. Now, it looks unclear whether that goal can be met. The 31-page long report details myriad technical issues that have put the project behind schedule. The contractor, Northrop Grumman, is trying to catch up but \"the contractor has increased its daily work shifts from two to three and is now working 24 hours per day on spacecraft integration, which further limits schedule flexibility.\"</p><p>With the delays that have cropped up, if nothing else goes wrong, there will only be one and a half months left in the launch window by the time the telescope is ready. And because this is a very delicate, very technically complex device, there is certainly more that will go wrong. The GAO estimates that because of this narrow time frame, \"we believe that the rescheduled launch window is likely unachievable.\"</p><p>The time issues are made even more complicated by the fact that the James Webb Space Telescope is running into its budget cap, which was mandated by Congress back in 2011. It\'s not clear what will happen from here; the next step is for the managing board of the James Webb Space Telescope to meet and determine whether the project can, indeed, be completed on time.</p>\n\n                          </div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n','2018-04-30 00:57:35','https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?quality=100&image_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fo.aolcdn.com%2Fhss%2Fstorage%2Fmidas%2Fce7b2f8beb7b78cbfa29f9410edb95b%2F206173595%2Fwebb-ed.jpg&client=cbc79c14efcebee57402&signature=e177d947b344086363fca82a869e45d3279f918d',10,'The James Webb Space Telescope may not be ready by June 2019.','NASA\'s Hubble successor may miss its launch window','2018-04-30 00:57:35',2),

The release describes it as, \"a giant donut of vaporized rock.\" Synestias only last a century or two before they condense into a planet.</p><p>\"Our model starts with a collision that forms a synestia,\" Simon Lock, a graduate student at Harvard and coauthor of the article, said <a href=\"https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2018-02/uoc--tmf022718.php\">in a release</a>. Once this occurred, the moon could have formed in a number of ways. The synestia may have ejected molten rock into its orbit, which began to form the moon. As the synestia shrank, the moon accumulated more matter. \"The Moon forms inside the vaporized Earth at temperatures of four to six thousand degrees Fahrenheit and pressures of tens of atmospheres,\" Lock said.</p><p>The current prevailing theory on the moon\'s formation surround <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2016/09/14/moon-birth-vaporized-earth/\">a collision between the Earth and a planetary body the size of Mars</a>. This crash ejected molten rock and metal, which eventually came together to create the moon. This new theory has one major advantage over that one; mainly, that it explains the similarities between the composition of the moon and the Earth, but it also leaves room for the differences: Because the moon formed at very high temperatures within the synestia, elements that could easily vaporize are not present on the moon.</p>\n\n                          </div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n','2018-05-02 00:57:35','https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?quality=100&image_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fo.aolcdn.com%2Fhss%2Fstorage%2Fmidas%2Fa982e52592d9fc74022af2194adc546c%2F206170060%2Fdonut-ed.jpg&client=cbc79c14efcebee57402&signature=4fbf788dea22be623352005a0b786a37be268dc2',10,'It\'s based on a theory that suggests our planet was \"a giant donut of vaporized rock.\"','The moon may have formed inside the early Earth','2018-05-02 00:57:35',1),

Shine two flashlights together, however and ... crickets. The photons simply pass through each other like phantoms and there\'s no reaction whatsoever. That\'s because they have no mass or charge, though they can become highly energized in the form of X-rays or gamma rays.</p><p>To get the photons together, then, the researchers beamed a very weak laser through a dense cloud of rubidium atoms cooled to a hair above absolute zero. Instead of exiting randomly one at a time as you\'d expect, they bound together in pairs or triplets, creating some form of entanglement. In addition, the normally mass-less photons gained some weight, as well -- a fraction of an electron\'s mass, but it\'s something.</p><p>The heftier photon \"molecules,\" if you like, were considerably less nimble, too. Rather than moving at their regular 186,000 mile per second pace, they were moving 100,000 times slower, less than SpaceX\'s Falcon Heavy <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2018/02/18/website-tracks-elon-musk-tesla-roadster-in-space/\">Tesla Roadster</a> is at the moment, by my calculation.</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"Image result for site:www.engadget.com light saber\" class=\"irc_mi\" onload=\"typeof google===\'object\'&&google.aft&&google.aft(this)\" src=\"https://s.aolcdn.com/hss/storage/midas/14257e92cc1ddcfc0d8ba56ca99899cd/203467374/kylo-ren-force-awakens-lucasfilm-1400.jpg\" style=\"margin-top: 0px;\" width=\"1251\" height=\"639\"></p><center><span class=\"t-meta c-gray-4\">For benefits, think computers, not light sabers (Lucasfilm/Disney)</span></center><p>How did this happen? When passing through the listless rubidium atoms, the photons passed on some of their energy. However, because of something called the Rydberg blockade, adjacent atoms can\'t be excited as much, and the less-agitated atom and a photon formed a hybrid called a \"polariton.\" As the photons skipped between polaritons, they interacted with each other in ways they normally wouldn\'t, and some were still stuck together when they exited the cloud. This happenned slowly on a quantum scale, about a millionth of a second from entry to exit.</p><p>It\'s not the first time scientists have got photons together; some of the same team managed to get pairs of photons <a href=\"https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2013/09/seeing-light-in-a-new-way/\">hooked together</a> in 2013. The new discovery, however, marks the first time that three photons have been forced to interact.</p><p>The research is not just interesting to particle physicists, but it could eventually pave the way to new types of quantum computers used to crack cryptographic codes and solve difficult equations. The photon triplets are essentially entangled, so they could be used in \"qubit\" processors or for transmitting information over long distances. Having multiple photons entangled would allow for more robust, powerful systems. \"The interaction of individual photons has been a very long dream for decades,\" said lead author and MIT professor Vladan Vuletic.</p>\n\n                          </div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n','2018-05-15 00:57:35','https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?quality=100&image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fo.aolcdn.com%2Fimages%2Fdims%3Fcrop%3D5760%252C3648%252C0%252C106%26quality%3D85%26format%3Djpg%26resize%3D1600%252C1014%26image_uri%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fo.aolcdn.com%252Fhss%252Fstorage%252Fmidas%252Ffa72c619c1e8a6d0b084c6b830fe2dcc%252F206138846%252Fquantum-optics-research-in-a-lab-picture-id489487607%26client%3Da1acac3e1b3290917d92%26signature%3Daf2f1ef83025fe528d9da4766fc79c02464f5bb4&client=cbc79c14efcebee57402&signature=b80ced651865b42ec601b78fc6060c18078a40a8',10,'Photons can hang out in groups and share information, it turns out.','A new form of light could power next-gen quantum computers','2018-05-15 00:57:35',2),

Typically, these networks learn how to perform tasks by analyzing huge sets of data and applying that to novel tasks. They\'re used for now-typical things like speech recognition,<a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2017/10/30/neural-network-nvidia-images-celebs/\"> photo </a><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2017/10/29/neural-network-fixes-phone-photo-quality/\">manipulation</a>, as well as more novel tasks, like reproducing what your <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2017/05/09/neural-network-recreates-brain-images/\">brain actually sees</a> and creating <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2017/04/10/neural-network-pickup-lines/\">quirky pickup lines</a> and <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2017/08/03/craft-beer-named-by-neural-network/\">naming craft beers</a>.</p><p>The problem is that neural nets are big, and the computations they run through are power-intensive. The ones in your phone tend to be tiny for that reason, which limits their ultimate practicality. In addition to power decreases, the new MIT chip increases the computation speed of neural networks by three to seven times over earlier iterations. The researchers were able to simplify the machine-learning algorithms in neural networks to a single point, called a dot product. This represents all the back and forth movement of various nodes in the neural network and obviates needing to pass that data back and forth to memory, like in earlier designs. The new chip can calculate dot products for multiple nodes (16 nodes in the prototype) in one step instead of moving the raw results of every computation between the processor and memory.</p><p>IBM\'s vice president of AI Dario Gil thinks this is an huge step forward. \"The results show impressive specifications for the energy-efficient implementation of convolution operations with memory arrays,\" he said in a statement. \"It certainly will open the possibility to employ more complex convolutional neural networks for image and video classifications in IoT in the future.\"</p>\n\n                          </div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n','2018-05-20 00:57:35','https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?quality=100&image_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fo.aolcdn.com%2Fhss%2Fstorage%2Fmidas%2F2136cf39a4bc43db8f47d5d540cd7e1c%2F206128184%2Fnetwork-ed.jpg&client=cbc79c14efcebee57402&signature=1560093cdcba3ca6b20954f8651067b8c2699b8f',10,'These chips process data seven times faster using 95 percent less power than traditional means.','MIT has a new chip to make AI faster and more efficient on smartphones','2018-05-20 00:57:35',1),

Abovitz said the cheapest version will cost you as much as a high-end smartphone -- he didn\'t clarify which, but <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/13/17010360/magic-leap-rony-abovitz-code-media-interview-pricing-tiers\">didn\'t object</a> when the iPhone X (priced at $1,000) was brought up. The most expensive variant will set you back as much as a high-end PC, but don\'t worry: that\'s not the one that\'s coming out in 2018. Apparently, the Creator Edition launching this year will be somewhere around the middle of the price range.</p><p>Once the first Magic Leap becomes available, you\'ll be able to watch <a href=\"https://www.magicleap.com/stories/blog/nba\">classic NBA games</a> or highlights from the ongoing series on the headset. Live games won\'t be available at first, but it\'s not because the parties involved don\'t want to give you access. It sounds like they\'re looking forward to making that happen: NBA SVP Jeff Marsilio said that the hope is to enable \"[live] streaming on your coffee table as though you were a giant looking into the arena from above.\"</p><p>Even if you won\'t be able to watch a live game like you\'re Gulliver on Lilliput yet, you\'ll be able to pin the screens where you\'re watching classic games and highlights to a virtual wall. That will simulate a giant movie projector you can watch in mixed reality. You can also pin other screens, such as one showing social media updates and another showing live stats, to that wall. The idea is to replace your TV, computer and your phone with one device where you can watch and do everything. In fact, that\'s what the company is hoping to happen and why Abovitz says its headsets\' pretty hefty price tags are worth it.</p><p>Check out Abovitz\'s interview below, with a guest appearance by Shaquille O\'neal wearing a pair of and talking about Magic Leap:</p><p style=\"text-align: center;\"><div class=\"fluid-width-video-wrapper\" style=\"padding-top: 60%;\"><iframe allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/m-Tp8-CAxPI\" id=\"fitvid0\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></div></p>\n\n                          </div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n','2018-05-21 00:57:35','https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?quality=100&image_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fo.aolcdn.com%2Fhss%2Fstorage%2Fmidas%2F3c54393c5ea7d17e910f244efdaa09%2F206124875%2Fmagic-leap.jpg&client=cbc79c14efcebee57402&signature=e404a63e609ebe43be1d42e67b3c8f29ff48a2e0',10,'The company has also teamed up with the NBA to show you basketball in mixed reality.','Magic Leap\'s AR headsets will start at around $1,000','2018-05-21 00:57:35',2),

Now it appears that it isn\'t even a top priority; <em>Ars Technica</em> reports that NASA will work on unmanned landers to the lunar surface between now and 2023. It\'s only after that NASA would begin work on a lander that would return humans to the surface, and the document has no projected date for when that would happen (but it would be well after 2024).

	(65,'<p>One of the biggest enemies of <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.brightspot.com/5-best-practices-brand-storytelling\">epic brand storytelling</a>&nbsp;is an outdated, legacy content management system (CMS). Many companies these days are finding their storytelling inhibited by these slow, antiquated technologies.</p><p>Last week, we hosted a&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://perfectsense.wistia.com/medias/7fn5h27hlq\">webinar</a>&nbsp;titled<i>&nbsp;The Evolution of Brand Storytelling: Taking a Newsroom Approach.&nbsp;</i>During the webinar we posed a simple question to the audience: \"What challenges do you currently experience publishing your content?\" The most popular responses were:</p><ul><li>Dependency on other departments (34%)</li><li>Too many disparate systems to work across (22%)</li><li>Delivering content across multiple channels (17%)</li><li>Standing up new experiences quickly (16%)</li></ul><p>If any of the above describes your organization,<b>&nbsp;it’s time to dump that rigid, inflexible, legacy CMS</b>&nbsp;and demand a faster, more scalable approach.</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://perfectsense.wistia.com/medias/7fn5h27hlq\"><b>Find out how a modern CMS transformed Johnson &amp; Johnson into a brand storytelling powerhouse.</b></a></p><p><b>Here are four ways a modern CMS can help eliminate bottlenecks and increase timeliness&nbsp;</b>in your quest to become an&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.brightspot.com/5-best-practices-brand-storytelling\">epic brand journalist</a>.</p><p>1. From Dependency to Independence&nbsp;<br>How many layers of red tape do you have to go through to make a small change to your website? Does it take hours for you to accomplish something that should take minutes? This is frequently the case with legacy CMS platforms. They are notoriously difficult to use and require an&nbsp;<b>overdependence on IT support</b>instead of empowering editors and daily system business users.</p><p>With a modern CMS, not only do you benefit from the richest of rich text editors but you can make changes quickly and easily without having to engage other departments. This will help your brand stay relevant and make adjustments quickly, which is key to successful brand storytelling.</p><p><i><b>Example:&nbsp;</b></i><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www2.brightspot.com/l/233992/2017-12-14/3h6w7\">Johnson &amp; Johnson</a>&nbsp;reduced the time required to upload videos from four hours + two IT team members to less than 10 minutes + one editorial user by switching from Drupal to Brightspot.</p><p>2. Playing Well with Others</p><p>Like the poll results signaled, editors and brand storytellers are challenged with&nbsp;<b>disparate, siloed systems&nbsp;</b>across the organization—creating inefficiences and wasting time. Compounding the number of disparate systems is the fact that many of them are legacy technologies that are difficult to integrate with or upgrade.</p><p>A modern CMS, on the other hand, works in tandem with other technologies/systems, or it can be the central digital hub of the organization. Either way,&nbsp;<b>your system is truly YOURS</b>—fitting the way you do business and playing well with the other technologies in your stack, while leaving room to incorporate new technology innovations and products as they emerge.</p><p><i><b>Example:</b></i>&nbsp;At National Geographic, the Brightspot platform runs all of&nbsp;<u><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.brightspot.com/customers/national-geographic\">Nat Geo\'s videos&nbsp;</a></u>while seamlessly integrating with a handful of other content and digital asset management tools the brand utilizes.</p><p>3. Signed, Sealed, Delivered</p><p>Telling great stories is difficult, but delivering those stories should not be. Maximizing your impact and becoming a master of different channels and types of content is a lot easier when you\'re using a modern CMS.&nbsp;<b>Multi-channel publishing is a given</b>&nbsp;and should be natively available within your modern CMS platform—making delivery of a consistent, personalized, and responsive experiences simple. New-age CMS platforms also make it easy to track how and where your content is best performing with built in-analytics and data visualization.</p><p><b><i>Example:</i>&nbsp;</b>Brightspot enabled&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www2.brightspot.com/sothebys-case-study\">Sotheby\'s</a>&nbsp;to provide richer, more engaging experiences by expanding its online Museum Network from just videos to other content formats, including articles, events, calendars and image galleries.</p><p>4. Lightening Fast</p><p>A modern CMS makes everything speedier: implement your new solution faster; deploy and deliver content via multiple channels faster; analyze and respond to changes in strategy and market conditions faster. Content delivery becomes easier and more intuitive and saves your company time and money. When it comes to brand storytelling,&nbsp;<b>the need for speed is paramount to staying relevant</b>&nbsp;and timely with trending stories. And acting like a true digital journalist.</p><p><i><b>Example:&nbsp;</b></i>After migrating their site from a legacy CMS to Brightspot, Hanley Wood decreased the amount of time it took to deploy a newsletter from two days to under two hours (in some cases, as little as 12 minutes), saving the 80 editors working across the CMS two to three hours per day.</p><p>Is your legacy technology inhibiting your storytelling efforts?
